Check if a username can or cannot be taken on a bunch of popular social websites (such as Twitter, Instagram, Soundcloud, Github etc.) 

Try it out at: https://username-check.herokuapp.com/   


## Setup

In case you want to try out project locally/contribute

### Install dependencies

Creating a virtual environment for the project is recommended.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

### Setup config file
Copy and rename .env.copy to .env by:

- Unix or Linux:

``` bash
cp .env.copy .env
```

```

You can choose to edit the default config before running the project


### Running the web app 

```
python username_api.py &
python frontend.py
```

To use, go to address generated by flask app in a browser.

### Running tests for flask backend

Tested on python 3.6

``` bash
python -m pytest -s -v
coala --non-interactive -V
```

### Running cli script

We don't test it often, so maybe it might be broken

```
python cli.py
```

## Backend API endpoint

This endpoint is responsible for returning the username status to the frontend 

- https://username-availability.herokuapp.com/check/<website name>/``<username>/``
- eg: https://username-availability.herokuapp.com/check/facebook/yolo
